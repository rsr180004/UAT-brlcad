This directory contains pre-generated outputs from the Perplex/RE2C/Lemon
toolchain.  Their purpose is to allow SC to build on platforms that do
not have those tools installed, when users/developers do not need to alter the
lexing and parsing logic.

DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES.  They are machine generated and should not be modified
directly - bugs in these files need to be fixed in either the
Perplex/RE2C/Lemon input files or the tools themselves.
