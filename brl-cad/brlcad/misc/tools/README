BRL-CAD maintains and uses a number of external libraries and tools critical
to its functionality that are not installed with the distribution. Generally
these are used either in various stages of the compilation process or as
maintenance tools.

The ext subdirectory holds tools where we can (or at least in principle would
like to) use system installed versions.  Tools at this level are written
by the project specifically for BRL-CAD.
