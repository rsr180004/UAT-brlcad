When working with a git repository on the command line, there is (by
default no visual indication of the current branch or state of the
repository.)  The following has proven useful for bash command line
workflows to know what a given repository's state is:

One caveat - if you have multiple terminals open, and change branches
in one of them, the other terminals will not automatically update their
report until the next command is entered in each terminal individually.
