Diffing between branches is more important in some ways in Git than it is in
SVN.  In particular, because Git commits do not retain branch origin
information, there is no simple way to list just the set of commits made to
that branch - once (for example) main is merged into the branch, main's commits
are also part of that branch's history.  Under those circumstances, the best
way to get a feel for work specific to the branch is to use git diff to see how
the branch differs from main.  For long lived branches with large diffs, the
--name-status feature can be a useful tool to get an overview.  Below is an
example during work on the opennurbs branch (because a new openNURBS version
was introduced, we also filter out src/other/openNURBS to get a sense of what
else in the tree has been altered:)

git diff --name-status main :^src\/other\/openNURBS
